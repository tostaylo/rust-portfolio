<p>What does it take to build a front-end framework? That was one of the questions on my mind during a recent development project brainstorming session. I knew I wanted to use Rust to create something new and I knew I needed to update my portfolio website. This led me to start researching how I could use Rust to build a website. At first I thought I may do a server rendered website with Rust and sprinkle some Javascript on top for the client interactions. The Rust ecosystem already contained some well know web frameworks I could use. However, I discovered I could give Rust a compilation target of Web Assembly which browsers understand! I could write the whole client in Rust and not touch Javascript myself (although under the hood JS would be needed to provide bindings for Rust).</p>
<p>Great! My mission had started. But one more thing occurred to me. It would be nice to have a client-side framework to write Rust with. The Rust ecosystem had one such client-side framework called Yew. Instead of choosing Yew I decided to take this opportunity and research how front-end frameworks work. Afterwords, I would try to develop one with Rust and Web Assembly. The mission just got way bigger!</p>
<h2 id="whatdoesafrontendframeworkdo">What does a front-end framework do?</h2>
<p>Many things. Some do much more than others. Here are some characteristics I have observed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides structure to your code</li>
<li>Manipulates DOM elements declaratively rather than imperatively</li>
<li>Manages state</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Updates the DOM intelligently</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Routing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whatdidiwantoutofafrontendframework">What did I want out of a front-end framework?</h2>
<p>I looked to the greats like React and Vue for inspiration.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reusable components</li>
<li>State management at the component level</li>
<li>Intelligent reactivity to state updates</li>
<li>HTML-like syntax for binding state with HTML elements</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="wheretostartbuildingthedom">Where to start? Building the DOM</h2>
<p>I wasn't sure where to start. Reusable components? State management? At the most fundamental level my framework needed to be able to create a DOM tree. Not only create a DOM tree, but do so declaratively rather than imperatively. Let's take a look at the opposing methods.</p>
<pre><code class="typescript language-typescript">const body = document.getElementByTagName('body');
const header = document.createElement('header');
const h1 = document.createElement('h1');
h1.innerText = 'I am an h1!';
h1.id = 'anH1';
header.appendChild(h1);
body.appendChild(header);
</code></pre>
<p><figcaption>Imperative DOM manipulation</figcaption></p>
<p>vs.</p>
<pre><code class="typescript language-typescript">App.render(
    &lt;Header&gt;
        &lt;H1 id="anH1" content="I am an h1!" /&gt;
    &lt;/Header&gt;,
    document.getElementByTagName('body')
);
</code></pre>
<p><figcaption>Declarative DOM composition</figcaption></p>
<p>The latter is an abstraction which hides the details of the work being done to render elements to the DOM.</p>
<p>More coming soonâ€¦</p>
